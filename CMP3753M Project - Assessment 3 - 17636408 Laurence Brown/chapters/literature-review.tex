\section{Background}
The literature review is an essential requirement of any academic project. A comprehensive review of the literature will provide background to the project. This section establishes what you intended to do and shows the reader that what you have done is the result of academic study, rather than an unfounded whim. This section can use the literature review submitted as part of the Interim Report. If you want to add to it, you can, but it is not directly assessed again.
\section{Related Literature}
As above. If you are undertaking an external project, you should also describe the client and outline the nature of their work or business and explain how the artefact will address the clientâ€™s needs.
