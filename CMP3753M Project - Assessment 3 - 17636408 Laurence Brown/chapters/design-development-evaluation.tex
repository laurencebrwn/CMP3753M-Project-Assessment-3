This section of the report will vary significantly in both structure and content, depending on the type of project you are undertaking. For example, a Games design project may include a Game Design Document. However, it must be noted that if your project contains significant software development work, this should be presented in the structure expected of a formal development report. If your project involves an experimental evaluation – especially if that evaluation involved human participants, you are expected to write this work up in the format expected in \hyperref[sec:research]{Section 4.2}. 

\section{Software Development Projects}
Include this section if you are undertaking a software development project. You should discuss:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Requirements elicitation, gathering, collection and analysis
    \item Design
    \item Building and programming
    \item Testing
    \item Operation
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Projects}
\label{sec:research}
If your project includes primary research components it is expected that you present this work in a manner appropriate to a scientific report:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Participant recruitment
    \item Evidence that ethical procedures have been followed
    \item Study design (short summary of research methods section) – including hypotheses/research question as appropriate
    \item A detailed description of the procedure
    \item Results of experiment
    \item  Analysis of results. Consider the results of your work with respect to both your own specific hypotheses/research question and wider context identified in your literature review.

\end{enumerate}
